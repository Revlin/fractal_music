Responsive Music Visualization using 2D Fractal Structures

August 4th 2013
!!!!! ALPHA CODE !!!!! PLEASE READ !!!!! USAGE BELOW !!!!!

This code isn't meant for general release, but it works!
I intend to significantly improve, streamline and extend
it in the coming weeks. Replace "track.mix" below to
enable live music input! Allow the visualization to
run for a few minutes to adapt the amplitude range
to your selected track/type of music.

If you manage to upload a high-quality screencast and send
me the link before I manage to do so, I'd be very happy.

Feel free to contact me for any feedback and inquiries.


Enjoy!

+++++USAGE+++++

Press "m" to cycle between 1) demo 2) music analysis and 3) manual user input mode.
Press "p" to loop the file named "track.mp3" located in the "data" subdirectory.
You may insert a supported MP3 file you own for this - pick you favourite track!
You may also use the supplied track which is free to use!

For music analysis mode:

Press "g" to reset learned amplitudes for all frequencies.

For manual mode:

Press "k" to clear the screen.
Press "i" to invert colours.
Press/hold "o" to dilate the drawing. [very slow in current implementation]
Press/hold "w" to increase size.
Press/hold "e" to decrease size.
Press/hold "r" to increase the number of sides / change the fractal shape.
Press/hold "t" to decrease the number of sides / change the fractal shape.

Left-click drag the mouse in order to change the strut factor along the X (width) axis.
