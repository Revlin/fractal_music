This is a work in progress - feel free to contact me for any feedback and inquiries.

Enjoy!

== Usage


Press "m" to cycle between 1) demo 2) music analysis and 3) manual user input mode.
Press "p" to loop the file named "track.mp3" located in the "data" subdirectory.
You may insert a supported MP3 file you own for this - pick you favourite track!
You may also use the supplied track which is free to use!

For music analysis mode:

Press "g" to reset learned amplitudes for all frequencies.

For manual mode:

Press "k" to clear the screen.
Press "i" to invert colours.
Press/hold "o" to dilate the drawing. [very slow in current implementation]
Press/hold "w" to increase size.
Press/hold "e" to decrease size.
Press/hold "r" to increase the number of sides / change the fractal shape.
Press/hold "t" to decrease the number of sides / change the fractal shape.

Left-click drag the mouse in order to change the strut factor along the X (width) axis.
